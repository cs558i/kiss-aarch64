# kiss-aarch64
KISS Linux ARM 64-bit

```Work in progress```

This is a repo for KISS Linux packages that are modified to work on aarch64.  Currently this is running on a [Pinebook Pro](https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/).  

Of the ```core``` set of packages, only 3 have had to be patched.  There will probably be more as I work through the other repos, but so far it seems to require less modification than ppc.

Installation instructions will be added soon.
